## üìñ Overview

The system enables viewers of live streams to react to meaningful moments with emotes. Raw reactions are processed into ‚Äúsignificant moments‚Äù and pushed to the frontend over WebSocket for a live experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is composed of five core components that work together to process and visualize emote data in real-time.

| Component                 | Technology                   | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üé≠ **Emote Generator**    | `Node.js`, `KafkaJS`         | Simulates user activity by producing a continuous stream of emote events to a Kafka topic.                                               |
| üß† **Server B**           | `Node.js`, `Express`, `KafkaJS` | Consumes raw emote events, analyzes them to find "significant moments," and exposes a REST API for dynamic configuration.                  |
| üîå **Server A**           | `Node.js`, `ws`, `KafkaJS`   | Consumes significant moments from Kafka and broadcasts them to all connected frontend clients via WebSockets.                          |
| üñ•Ô∏è **Frontend**            | `React`, `Nginx`             | Visualizes significant moments and provides a UI to configure the analysis settings. Served by Nginx, which also acts as a reverse proxy. |
| üîó **Kafka**              | `KRaft mode`                 | The central message broker, decoupling services and enabling asynchronous, durable communication.                                        |

    SA --o|WebSocket| FE
    FE -->|HTTP API| SB
```

### Kafka Topics
- `raw-emote-data`: Carries raw emote events from the Emote Generator to Server B. Each message represents a single emote reaction.
- `aggregated-emote-data`: Transports processed, significant moments from Server B to Server A. Each message contains a batch of moments that have met the defined analysis criteria.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **‚ö° Real-Time Updates**: Significant moments are delivered to the frontend in real-time using WebSockets. Server A pushes moments as soon as they are processed, and the React frontend updates dynamically.

-   **üîß Configurable Analysis**: The analysis logic is highly configurable via a REST API. Dynamically adjust the processing interval, significance threshold, and tracked emotes to tune the system's behavior on the fly.

-   **üé® Interactive UI with Animations**: The React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for viewing moments and configuring settings. New moments trigger floating emote animations, enhancing the user experience.

-   **üê≥ Fully Containerized**: The entire application is orchestrated with Docker Compose, enabling a consistent, one-command startup for all services, including the Kafka message broker.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to be run with Docker Compose for a quick and easy setup.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18+) and npm (for local development)

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to launch the entire application stack.

1.  **Launch all services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Monitor logs:**
    To view the logs for all services in real-time, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```
    Or, for a specific service (e.g., `server-b`):
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f server-b
    ```

4.  **Shut down the system:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

<details>
<summary>üíª Local Development (Manual Setup)</summary>

If you prefer to run the services manually without Docker:

1.  **Start Kafka:**
    You still need Kafka. The easiest way is to start it via Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d kafka
    ```

2.  **Run Each Service:**
    For each service (`emote-generator`, `server-a`, `server-b`):
    -   Navigate to the service directory (e.g., `cd server-b`).
    -   Install dependencies: `npm install`.
    -   Set the required environment variables (see [Configuration](#-configuration)).
    -   Start the service: `npm start`.

    **Example for Server B:**
    ```bash
    cd server-b
    npm install
    export KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
    export KAFKA_TOPIC_IN=raw-emote-data
    export KAFKA_TOPIC_OUT=aggregated-emote-data
    export PORT=3001
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend:**
    The React development server can be started for a better development experience:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The API and WebSocket URLs in `src/App.js` are pre-configured for this setup.

</details>

<details id="configuration">
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Configuration</summary>

The system is configured using environment variables, which are defined in `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment and can be set in the shell for local development.

### Environment Variables

| Service          | Variable          | Description                                  | Default Value        |
| :--------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Emote Gen**    | `KAFKA_BROKER`    | Address of the Kafka broker                  | `kafka:9092`         |
|                  | `KAFKA_TOPIC`     | Topic for raw emote data                     | `raw-emote-data`     |
| **Server B**     | `KAFKA_BROKER`    | Address of the Kafka broker                  | `kafka:9092`         |
|                  | `KAFKA_TOPIC_IN`  | Topic for consuming raw emotes               | `raw-emote-data`     |
|                  | `KAFKA_TOPIC_OUT` | Topic for publishing aggregated emotes       | `aggregated-emote-data` |
|                  | `PORT`            | Port for the REST API server                 | `3001`               |
| **Server A**     | `KAFKA_BROKER`    | Address of the Kafka broker                  | `kafka:9092`         |
|                  | `KAFKA_TOPIC`     | Topic for consuming aggregated data          | `aggregated-emote-data` |
|                  | `PORT`            | Port for the WebSocket server                | `3002`               |
| **Frontend**     | `WEBSOCKET_URL`   | URL for the WebSocket server (for Nginx)     | `ws://localhost:3002` |
|                  | `API_URL`         | URL for the REST API (for Nginx)             | `http://localhost:3001`|

### Customization

To customize the configuration for Docker Compose, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the project and override the default values. For example, to change the port for the frontend:

```env
# .env file
FRONTEND_PORT=8081
```

Then, modify `docker-compose.yml` to use this variable:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "${FRONTEND_PORT:-8080}:80"
```
This will expose the frontend on port `8081`, or `8080` if the variable is not set.

<details id="api--contracts">
<summary>üîå API & Contracts</summary>

This section details the data contracts for the REST API, WebSocket connections, and Kafka topics.

### Server B ‚Äì Settings API (REST)

Server B exposes a REST API for managing the analysis settings.

**Endpoints:**

-   `GET /settings/interval`: Retrieves the current analysis interval.
-   `PUT /settings/interval`: Updates the analysis interval.
-   `GET /settings/threshold`: Retrieves the current significance threshold.
-   `PUT /settings/threshold`: Updates the significance threshold.
-   `GET /settings/allowed-emotes`: Retrieves the list of emotes being tracked.
-   `PUT /settings/allowed-emotes`: Updates the list of tracked emotes.

*For detailed request/response payloads, see the source code in `server-b/index.js`.*

### Server A ‚Äì WebSocket

Server A broadcasts messages to all connected frontend clients.

-   **Connection**: On success, the server sends a `{ "type": "connection", ... }` message.
-   **Broadcasts**: Significant moments are sent as `{ "type": "significant-moments", "data": [...] }` messages.

### Kafka Payloads

-   **`raw-emote-data`**: Contains individual emote events as JSON objects: `{ "emote": "üëç", "timestamp": "..." }`.
-   **`aggregated-emote-data`**: Contains an array of significant moments identified during an analysis window.
