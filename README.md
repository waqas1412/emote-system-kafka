## Overview
The system enables viewers of live streams to react to meaningful moments with emotes. Raw reactions are processed into ‚Äúsignificant moments‚Äù and pushed to the frontend over WebSocket for a live experience.

## Architecture

### Components
- **Emote Generator**: A Node.js service using `KafkaJS` that simulates user activity by producing a continuous stream of emote events. It generates both single emotes and bursts of emotes to create realistic data patterns for testing the system's processing capabilities.
- **Server B (Analyzer + Settings API)**: A Node.js service that serves as the core data processing engine. It uses `KafkaJS` to consume raw emote events from the `raw-emote-data` topic. The service aggregates these events into time windows, analyzes them to identify "significant moments" based on configurable thresholds, and then publishes these moments to the `aggregated-emote-data` topic. It also exposes a REST API using `Express` for dynamically configuring the analysis parameters (e.g., interval, threshold, and allowed emotes).
- **Server A (WebSocket Gateway)**: A Node.js service responsible for real-time communication with the frontend. It uses `KafkaJS` to consume the `aggregated-emote-data` topic and broadcasts these significant moments to all connected clients via a WebSocket server implemented with the `ws` library.
- **Frontend**: A `React` single-page application that provides a user interface for visualizing significant moments and adjusting the analysis settings. It's served by `Nginx`, which also acts as a reverse proxy, directing API requests (`/api`) to Server B and WebSocket connections (`/ws`) to Server A.
- **Kafka**: The central message broker of the system, running in KRaft mode (without Zookeeper). It decouples the services, enabling them to communicate asynchronously and ensuring data durability and scalability.

    SA -- "WebSocket<br/>{\"type\": \"significant-moments\", ...}" --> FE
    FE -- "HTTP API<br/>GET /settings" --> SB
```

### Kafka Topics
- `raw-emote-data`: Carries raw emote events from the Emote Generator to Server B. Each message represents a single emote reaction.
- `aggregated-emote-data`: Transports processed, significant moments from Server B to Server A. Each message contains a batch of moments that have met the defined analysis criteria.

## Features

-   **Real-time Updates**: The system delivers significant moments to the frontend in real time using a WebSocket connection. **Server A** listens for messages on the `aggregated-emote-data` Kafka topic and immediately broadcasts them to all connected clients. The React frontend uses a `useEffect` hook to manage the WebSocket lifecycle, ensuring a persistent connection and updating the UI state as new moments arrive.

-   **Configurable Analysis**: The core analysis logic in **Server B** is highly configurable via a REST API. The frontend can dynamically adjust the `interval` (the number of messages to process in a batch), the `threshold` (the ratio required for a moment to be considered significant), and the list of `allowedEmotes`. These settings are held in memory on Server B and directly influence the behavior of the `analyzeEmotes` function.

-   **Interactive UI with Animations**: The React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for both viewing significant moments and configuring the system. When a new significant moment is received, the application triggers a floating emote animation using CSS. This provides immediate visual feedback and enhances the user experience.

-   **Fully Containerized**: The entire application stack is defined in `docker-compose.yml`, allowing for a consistent, one-command startup of all services, including the Kafka message broker. This simplifies the development setup and ensures that the application runs the same way in any environment.

## Getting started

This project is designed to be run with Docker Compose, but individual services can also be run locally for development.

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v18+) and npm (if running services locally)

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to start the entire system.

1.  **Start all services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
2.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

3.  **View logs:**
    To view the logs for all services, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```
    Or for a specific service (e.g., `server-b`):
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f server-b
    ```

4.  **Stop all services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Local Development (Manual)

If you want to run services individually without Docker:

1.  **Start Kafka:**
    You still need Kafka running. You can start just Kafka using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d kafka
    ```
2.  **Run a service:**
    For each service (`emote-generator`, `server-a`, `server-b`, `frontend`):
    - Navigate to the service directory (e.g., `cd server-b`).
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
    - Set environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration)) and start the service: `npm start`.

    **Example for Server B:**
    ```bash
    cd server-b
    npm install
    export KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
    export KAFKA_TOPIC_IN=raw-emote-data
    export KAFKA_TOPIC_OUT=aggregated-emote-data
    export PORT=3001
    npm start
    ```
3.  **Run the frontend:**
    The frontend requires a slightly different setup.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The React development server will open the app at `http://localhost:3000`. The API and WebSocket URLs in `src/App.js` are pre-configured to point to `localhost:3001` and `localhost:3002`.

## Configuration

The system is configured using environment variables, which are defined in `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment and can be set in the shell for local development.

### Environment Variables

**Emote Generator:**
-   `KAFKA_BROKER`: The address of the Kafka broker. Default: `kafka:9092`.
-   `KAFKA_TOPIC`: The topic to which raw emote data is published. Default: `raw-emote-data`.

**Server B (Analyzer + Settings API):**
-   `KAFKA_BROKER`: The address of the Kafka broker. Default: `kafka:9092`.
-   `KAFKA_TOPIC_IN`: The topic from which to consume raw emote data. Default: `raw-emote-data`.
-   `KAFKA_TOPIC_OUT`: The topic to which aggregated data is published. Default: `aggregated-emote-data`.
-   `PORT`: The port on which the REST API server runs. Default: `3001`.

**Server A (WebSocket Gateway):**
-   `KAFKA_BROKER`: The address of the Kafka broker. Default: `kafka:9092`.
-   `KAFKA_TOPIC`: The topic from which to consume aggregated data. Default: `aggregated-emote-data`.
-   `PORT`: The port on which the WebSocket server runs. Default: `3002`.

**Frontend:**
-   `WEBSOCKET_URL`: The URL for the WebSocket server (Server A). Used by the Nginx proxy. Default: `ws://localhost:3002`.
-   `API_URL`: The URL for the REST API (Server B). Used by the Nginx proxy. Default: `http://localhost:3001`.

### Customization

To customize the configuration for Docker Compose, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the project and override the default values. For example, to change the port for the frontend:

```env
# .env file
FRONTEND_PORT=8081
```

Then, modify `docker-compose.yml` to use this variable:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "${FRONTEND_PORT:-8080}:80"
```
This will expose the frontend on port `8081`, or `8080` if the variable is not set.

## API & contracts

This section details the data contracts for the REST API, WebSocket connections, and Kafka topics.

### Server B ‚Äì Settings API (REST)

Server B exposes a REST API for managing the analysis settings.

    -   **Description**: Retrieves the current analysis interval.
    -   **Response**: `200 OK`
        ```json

    -   **Error**: `400 Bad Request` if `allowedEmotes` is not a non-empty array.


### Server A ‚Äì WebSocket

Server A broadcasts messages to all connected frontend clients.

**Connection:**
-   Upon successful connection, the server sends a welcome message:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "connection",
      "message": "Connected to Server A"
    }
    ```

**Broadcast Messages:**
-   When significant moments are detected, the server broadcasts the following message:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "significant-moments",
      "data": [
        {
          "emote": "üî•",
          "timestamp": "2025-05-01T10:20:30.000Z",
          "count": 42,
          "ratio": 0.72
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    }
    ```
